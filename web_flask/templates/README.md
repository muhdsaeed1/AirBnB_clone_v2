## WEB TEMPLATES IN HTML /CSS

A website template is a pre-built website composed of HTML pages that include integrated images, text content and support files for font styles and Javascripts. The end user plugs their information, text and images, into the pre-built design and then uploads to a web hosting account for viewing on the Internet. Template designs, like the ones provided by Allwebco, are self contained, or stand alone, web sites downloaded in zip file format. This allows the purchaser to completely own and freely use the website they are developing including all source code, stock photos and files.

Web templates and website templates are the same thing. An HTML web template may be built using HTML or XHTML and will include CSS and Javascript code. PHP and ASP templates in most cases will also include either HTML or XHTML code. HTML 5 is the current version, however the previous version, HTML 4.01 was in use for a number of years and is still in use on many websites. The latest version of HTML5, created by WHATWG, became a stable W3C recommendation, with formal ratification, on Oct 28, 2014. It is supported by all new web browsers and mobile devices and is in widespread use on many popular websites.
